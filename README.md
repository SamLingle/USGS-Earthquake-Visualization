The United States Geological Survey collects and provides sceintific data about natural hazards, the ecological health of our environment, and the impacts of land use and climate change. Much of the collected data is open source and updated frequently allowing for very accurate and dynamic data sets. This project is intended to combine data gathered from seismographic monitors that record and report any earthquake related data to the USGS website with the JavaScript library for interactive maps, Leaflet.
